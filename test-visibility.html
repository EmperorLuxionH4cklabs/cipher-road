        <h2>Test Instructions</h2>
        <p>This test helps verify that the vehicle visibility fix is working correctly.</p>
        
        <h3>üéØ How to Test:</h3>
        <div class="step">1. Start the game by opening the main game page</div>
        <div class="step">2. Move the player forward 5-10 times using arrow keys or buttons</div>
        <div class="step">3. Look at vehicles/obstacles in lanes around you</div>
        <div class="step">4. Move backward 5-10 times</div>
        <div class="step">5. Look at vehicles/obstacles again</div>
        
        <h3>‚úÖ Expected Behavior (Fixed):</h3>
        <div class="expected">‚Ä¢ Vehicles should remain visible throughout player movement</div>
        <div class="expected">‚Ä¢ Cars and trucks should appear and disappear smoothly based on distance</div>
        <div class="expected">‚Ä¢ No sudden popping or disappearing of nearby obstacles</div>
        <div class="expected">‚Ä¢ Obstacles should be visible in a reasonable radius around the player</div>
        
        <h3>‚ùå Bug Behavior (Original Issue):</h3>
        <div class="bug">‚Ä¢ Vehicles become completely invisible after a few player movements</div>
        <div class="bug">‚Ä¢ Obstacles don't reappear when player moves back</div>
        <div class="bug">‚Ä¢ Game feels empty or broken due to missing obstacles</div>
        
        <h3>üîß Technical Details:</h3>
        <p>The fix increases the vehicle visibility distance from 5 tiles to 15 tiles, ensuring vehicles remain visible within the camera's field of view while maintaining performance optimization for distant objects.</p>

        <h2>üêõ Still Experiencing Issues?</h2>
        <p>If you still see vehicles disappearing, please check:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Browser console for any JavaScript errors</li>
            <li>Whether the issue occurs consistently or only in certain scenarios</li>
            <li>If it happens with cars, trucks, or both types of obstacles</li>
            <li>Whether trees/forest obstacles are affected</li>
