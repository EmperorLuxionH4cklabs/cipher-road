# Fix Summary: Vehicle Visibility Issue

## Problem
- Obstacles (cars and trucks) became invisible after player movements
- Caused by overly aggressive performance optimization (5-tile visibility distance)

## Solution  
- Increased vehicle visibility distance from 5 to 15 tiles
- Made the distance configurable via `GAME_CONFIG.VEHICLE_VISIBILITY_DISTANCE`
- Added comprehensive documentation and testing instructions

## Files Modified
- `dist/script.js` - Updated visibility logic (5 lines)
- `dist/constants.js` - Added configuration constant (3 lines)
- Added test and documentation files

## Result
- ✅ Obstacles remain visible during normal gameplay
- ✅ Performance optimization maintained for distant vehicles  
- ✅ Fix applies to both desktop and mobile versions
- ✅ Configurable for future adjustments

## Testing
Manual testing required - use `test-visibility.html` and follow instructions in `FIX_DOCUMENTATION.md`
